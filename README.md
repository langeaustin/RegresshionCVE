While browsing my daily hackread articles I found this one for openSSH. Immediately I got to work on putting out a notice by running an nmap scan for all devices in the office running the versions that had the vulnerability.
I then sent the list to my networks team. We were able to patch the vulnerable devices and avoided any issues.
